# Processwire Page Hit Counter
![alt text](https://github.com/FlipZoomMedia/RepoAssets/blob/master/pagehitcounter-example.png)
## Simple Page View Tracking

The Page Hit Counter module for processwire implements a simple page view counter in backend. Page views of visitors are automatically tracked on defined templates, with monitoring of multiple page views.

This gives you a quick overview of how many visitors have read a news or a blog post, for example, without first having to open complex tools such as Google Analytics. This module quickly provides simple information, e.g. for editors.

Works with `ProCache` and `AdBockers`. With a lightweight tracking code of only ~ 400 bytes (gzipped). And no code changes necessary! In addition GDPR compliant, since no personal data or IP addresses are stored. Only session cookies are stored without information.

In addition, there are some options, for example filtering IP addresses (for CronJobs) and filtering bots, spiders and crawlers. You can also configure the lifetime of the session cookies. Repeated page views are not counted during this period. It is also possible to exclude certain roles from tracking. For example, logged in editors who work on a page are not counted as page views.

## Sort by hits and access page views (hit value)
Each trackable template has an additional field called `phits`. For example, you want to output all news sorted by the number of page views.
```php
// It is assumed that the template, e.g. with the name "news", has been configured for tracking.
$news = $pages->find("template=news, sort=-phits");
```
To output the page views of a tracked page, use:
```php
echo $page->phits;
```

#### Notes
*By default, the page views are stored as `INT` in the database. This allows a maximum counter value of 4.2 billion views (4,294,967,295) per page. If you need more, change the type to `BIGINT` directly in the database. But I recommend to use Google Analytics or similar tools if you have such a large number of users.*
